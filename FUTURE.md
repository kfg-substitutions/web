Things I might do in the future:

- use a state management library
- refetch state in admin after mutations - DONE
- react-query for data fetching - DONE
- migrate axios to react-query
- excalidraw for logical diagrams - STARTED
- aws service < - > communcation
- mobile app
- readme project description
- complete AWS infrastructure with serverless OR railway.app project integration
- NOTE: Railway.app has no fitting free plan, while AWS offers a bunch of other cool stuff
- etc...
